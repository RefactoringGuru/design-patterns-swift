/// Facade Design Pattern

class FacadeRealWorld: XCTestCase {

    /// In the real project, you probably will use third-party libraries. For
    /// instance, to download images.
    ///
    /// Therefore, facade and wrapping it is a good way to use a third-party API
    /// in the client code. Even if it is your own library that is connected to
    /// a project.
    ///
    /// The benefits here are:
    ///
    /// 1) If you need to change a current image downloader it should be done
    /// only in the one place of a project. A number of lines of the client code
    /// will stay work.
    ///
    /// 2) The facade provides an access to a fraction of a functionality that
    /// fits most client needs. Moreover, it can set frequently used or default
    /// parameters.
